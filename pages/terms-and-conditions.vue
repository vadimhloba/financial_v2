				<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
				<p>You and we agree that if any concerns, complaints, demands for relief, disputes, or claims arise between you and Financial Match related to your visit or use of the Website, any Request you make through the Website, your relationship with Financial Match, communications with us or on behalf of us (including, but not limited to, telephone calls, text messages, emails, and indirect communications with us through third parties), any Services, or anything related to this Agreement (a “Dispute”) arises that is not resolved informally shall be resolved on an individual basis through binding arbitration or in small claims court only. YOU AND FINANCIAL MATCH ALSO AGREE TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY WAY IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH DISPUTES, OR TO MAKE OR PROCEED WITH ANY CLAIM ON A COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. Before you or Financial Match can file a claim in arbitration or small claims court, you and Financial Match are each required first to participate in an informal settlement process for a period of sixty (60) days for the purpose of resolving any Dispute. To initiate the informal settlement process, the claiming party must send to the other party a short, written statement (a “Claim Statement”) providing the claimant’s name and address; explaining the Dispute in sufficient detail for the other party to understand and investigate it; and presenting a proposal for resolving it (including any amount of money being claimed and how that amount was calculated). You agree to send each Claim Statement by email to admin@financialmatch.com or by certified mail, return receipt requested to 30 North Gould Street Ste 28553 Sheridan, WY, 82801. If applicable, Financial Match agrees to send each Claim Statement by email to an email address you have previously provided to Financial Match or by certified mail, return receipt requested to an address you have previously provided to Financial Match. You and Financial Match will then, upon receipt of any Claim Statement, attempt in good faith to resolve each Dispute described in the Claim Statement on an individual basis. If any such Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days following the receipt of a Claim Statement, you and Financial Match thereafter have the right to resolve any such Dispute either in small claims court or by individual arbitration, subject to the requirements described below. At the conclusion of the sixty (60) day informal settlement period, Disputes presented in a Claim Statement, but not resolved, may be asserted on an individual basis in either (1) small claims court in: (a) the county or parish where you live, if such a court is available and has jurisdiction to hear the Dispute; or (b) another location you and Financial Match agree on, but only if the Disputes (and the relief sought) qualify to be brought in that court; or (2) binding individual arbitration as provided for in this agreement, below. You and Financial Match agree that all arbitrations between you and Financial Match under this agreement are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal law, notwithstanding any state or local laws, or the laws of other countries, concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration or imposing obligations greater than, or inconsistent with, the FAA. In all other respects, the laws of the State of Wyoming shall control to the fullest extent permitted, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, but only to the extent that the laws of Wyoming are consistent with the FAA. With regard to dispute resolution between you and Financial Match (including arbitration), if there is a conflict between this provision and any other provision of this Agreement regarding governing law, this provision shall control. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims brought under any legal theory; claims that may arise during and after the termination of your involvement or relationship with Financial Match; claims brought by or against Financial Match; claims brought by or against you, the respective affiliates and parent companies of User and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, predecessors, successors, and assigns of these entities. Arbitration shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) pursuant to the then-current American Arbitration Association (AAA) pursuant to the then-current AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, which you can find here: https://www.adr.org/commercial. All disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated either by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions, including affidavits, and will not involve any personal appearances by parties or witnesses unless you and we agree otherwise. The arbitrator’s award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. You and Financial Match will each bear their own respective costs and attorneys’ fees in the event of a Dispute; provided, however, that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s and arbitral fees to the extent permitted by applicable law or under applicable arbitration rules. If an arbitrator determines that an arbitration has been brought in bad faith, for an improper purpose, or to exert unfair pressure greatly disproportionate to the harm alleged, or that the demand was entirely frivolous, the arbitrator may award costs, arbitration fees, and attorneys’ fees to the party defending itself in connection with any such Disputes. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision and the arbitrability of any dispute, shall be determined by the arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the relief available to either you as an individual or Financial Match in arbitration or small claims court, including equitable relief that an arbitrator may be required to make available by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Wyoming: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or contesting the validity of our or one of our family company’s intellectual property rights and proprietary rights, including without limitation, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, or trade secrets; (ii) an action by us for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief; (iii) any legal action by us against a non-consumer; and (iv) interactions with governmental and regulatory authorities. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS OR THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLAIMS OR DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this limitation on class proceedings as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in Sheridan County, Wyoming or the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. You shall have thirty (30) days from the earliest of the date that you visit the Website, or submit information through the Website to opt out of this arbitration provision and class action waiver, by contacting us by email at admin@financialmatch.com. If you do not opt out by the earliest of the date that you visit the Website, or submit information through the Website, then you are not eligible to opt out.</p>
